Uploadr.py
==========

Uploadr.py is a simple Python script for uploading your photos to Flickr. Unlike
many GUI applications out there, it lends itself to automation; and because it's
free and open source, you can just change it if you don't like it.

I have tweaked quite a few features from the original source, so some features might not work similar to the ones in the original source. The source is fairly clear, but if you would like to pay to get documentation and tips on how best to use this script, or just buy me a coffee to appreciate a work, you can do so here : http://go.ankitdaf.com/uploadr
Now support local file deletion on successful upload, logging by file hash, some 
other minor changes.


Authentication
--------------

To use this application, you need to obtain your own Flickr API key and secret
key. You can apply for keys `on the Flickr website
<http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/>`_.

When you have got those keys, you need to set environment variables so that they
can be used by this application. For example, if you use Bash, add the following
lines to your ``$HOME/.bash_profile``::

    export FLICKR_UPLOADR_PY_API_KEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
    export FLICKR_UPLOADR_PY_SECRET=0123456789abcdef

Additional Requirement
----------------------
this fork implements image resize feature before uploading to Flickr. This requires you to have Python Image Library (PIL) installed in your Python environment
refer to http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil for installation

tested on Python 2.7, this module is still functioning properly

Also included is pexif module from (https://github.com/bennoleslie/pexif) to copy important EXIF information (Model, Maker, GPS data) to resized image.

Usage
-----
if you have setup default image directory to upload, then just issue command
``python uploadr.py ``

for more help on additional parameters
``python uploadr.py --help``


To upload specific directory and do resizing to 1280 pixel wide:
``python uploadr.py -p 1280 "/Users/name/pictures/2013/bikes" ``
